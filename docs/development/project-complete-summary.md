- Three options: QR Scan, Manual Entry, Network Discovery
- Optimized layout with proper text visibility
- Material 3 design with consistent spacing

### 2. Network Discovery Screen
- Real-time network scanning with progress indicators
- Validated camera detection with RTSP testing
- Clean UI with device cards and status information
- 45-second timeout with user feedback

### 3. Live View Screen
- Full-screen video streaming
- Player controls and status indicators
- Error handling with retry options
- Connection status display

### 4. Manual Setup Screen
- Camera configuration form
- IP, port, username, password fields
- Validation and error handling

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Network Discovery
```kotlin
// Key components:
- NetworkUtils.testCameraConnectivity(): RTSP validation
- OnvifDiscovery.scanNetworkForDevices(): Network scanning
